This document will discuss and describe to process of building this website.

To begin was the moodboard which would select the colour pallet that would be used to decorate the page, with its backgrounds and interations, such as buttonss. A list of what could be achieved in the website. The logo of the "business". And finally, two fonts that be used as headers for the pages, and any text that would be used in paragraph formats.

Next was the low fidelity protoypes, in which the webpages had an idea to off with, in regards to spacing and sizing.

They would have two consistent sets of items on them, the header and footer. The header hosts the businesses logo, and a few buttons which can lead the user to different pages. Whereas the footer hosts the contact information of the business owner, alongside their phone number. There is a geographical map. And further on is the FAQ, T&Cs and products page respectively.

In what could be considered the middle section of the page would hold whatever relevent input there is, for example the homepage hosts a carosel, which is manually moved by the user, hosting information for them to see upon first glance.

Another example for the sectionn to be filled in is the products page, in which it hosts various images in a contained format, from a design choice, it can be done differently than intended, such as placing multiple pages and using pagination to expand on what could be available. The design choice was a larger carousel that the user could swipe.

This website implemented React Bootstrap to the best of the given ability, many forums were useful including stackoverflow.

Inspiration was taken from Jakob Nielsens 10 heuristics for user interface design found here https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/

All images are in relation to Call of Duty, there is no afficilation with Activision, Treyarch or any of their teams, this is a create lisence product.
