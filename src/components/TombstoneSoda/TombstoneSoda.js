<p> Rest in pieces
Down for the count
No revival
You're bleeding out

Your epitaph says you died a wealthy man
But you can have it all come back
It's in the massive plan

With Tombstone, it's Tombstone
It's Tombstone, it's Tombstone

Health is drainin'
You're on the ropes
Death is waiting
Don't lose your hopes

Your will and testament ain't making that much sense
You're listed as the only heir to whom you may bequest

It's Tombstone, it's Tombstone</p>

  With this perk you will be able to go down and into the beyond
  With the promise of regaining all your other bought perks and weapons
